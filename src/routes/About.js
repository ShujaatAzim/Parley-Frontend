        <h1>About Parley</h1>
          <p>Parley is an app that aims to connect people who fundamentally disagree about certain topics. While politics and hot-button topics
            immediately spring to mind - especially in this day and age - Parley can and should be used to debate with anyone about anything. 
            
            Far too often, it is simply feels easier to dismiss those with whom we disagree as "stupid" or "uninformed". I myself used to function this 
            way - after all, who doesn't like bathing in one's own superiority?
            
            Defined as "a conference between opposing sides in a dispute, especially a discussion of terms for an armistice", Parley serves to 
            connect those who are curious with those who are willing. The weapons need not be bared before a parley is initiated - similarly,
            a topic need not be world-shatteringly important before a discussion about it is initiated.
